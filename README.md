### Tech Stack
- Reactjs
- Typescript
- Chakra UI (CSS Framework)
- Supabase (Database as service)

### Fetures & implementation
- Search articles by author name and article title (used debouncing functnality to reduce the network call of an api)
- Comment on and “like" the post. They may also “like"
comments.

##### Note: 

Since it has no authentication to verified that the user has already like the post so i have simpely added the increment and decremnt functnality as 
liking and disliking post as well as for liking the comment so on.
